# Hangman_Game

PROJECT ON CREATION OF HANGMAN GAME USING PYTHON.

EXPLANATION:

In this project, I have used the basic concepts of python. Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language. It has simple and easy to use syntax making it a perfect language. It is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.

# FEATURES:

In this, I have a separate file named ‘words.txt’ which contains different words related to the concepts in python (eg. List, string, dictionary etc). 
I have used basic file operations such as open, read etc. to use the words in the program. To choose a random word for the user to guess, I have used random module. 

# REMEMBER:

The category of words in this game is CONCEPTS IN PYTHON.
The program will prompt the user to guess a letter. There is a list of alphabets from which user will select appropriate letter. 
According to the selection made, the program responds in the following way:

1] If the user selected a letter, which is present in the word, it will fill that letter in the word.

2] If the selected letter is wrong, then a chance is reduced. There are total 7 chances for the user to guess. The chances will decrease if the user enters a wrong letter.

3] On reaching the second last chance, the user will get a hint of a letter in the word which is not yet guessed by the user. But, along with the hint, 1 chance is reduced from the chances left.

4] If the user enters 2 letters in a single chance or repeats a letter which he already guessed previously, then appropriate messages are displayed. Also, chances are not reduced in such cases.

5] The set of remaining alphabets are displayed for user’s reference.

6] Whether or not, the user is successful in guessing the word, he will have the option of playing the game again.

# Concepts used in the project:

• Random Module
• File Handling
• Functions
• Lists
• Strings
• Conditional Statements
• Iterative Statements.

This was an academic Project.
